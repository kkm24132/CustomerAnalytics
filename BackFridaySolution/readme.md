## Problem Statement

A retail company “ABC Private Limited” wants to understand the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against
various products of different categories. They have shared purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products 
from last month.
The data set also contains customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, city_type, stay_in_current_city), 
product details (product_id and product category) and Total purchase_amount from last month.

create personalized offer for customers against different products.
